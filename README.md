Analysis of the salary Structure in Saudi Arabia
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I have uploaded this Project on Github.

In this project, I have used the Dataset of -average-salaries-by-education-in-saudi-arabia.

The following questions are selected by me to analyse this dataset.

1. How much is the salary increase berween 2017 and 2021 , for different type of education?
2. What is the salary difference for Male and Female employees during 2017-2021 ?
3. what is the percentage of salary for Saudis compared to Non Saudis ?

After the analysis with three questions, I could find out that;

-- we can see there is an overall slight decrease of about 0.65 % in the salary annually for different degree levels .
   except Masters , Doctorate where the increase is about 5.5 % appx
-- we can observe that the Salary was always higher by 29% to 36% for Male Employees when compared to Female Employees.

-- we can see that the salary range for the Saudis is always more than that of Non-Saudis.

This Dataset is available for review at : https://www.kaggle.com/majedalhulayel/average-salaries-by-education-in-saudi-arabia.

I have used to Python , using Jupyter Notebook to write the code for the Visuals using third party modules Pandas and Matplotlib. 

Your suggestions for any improvement are welcome .
